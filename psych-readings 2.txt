 PSYCH 1000 --- LECT & READING NOTES

lect1 :  Facilitated Communication p.1-12
-------------------------------------------
> neil 25 is autistic, no verbal communication
> echolalic speech = echo back what was heard
> Facilitated comm. developed by Rosemary Crossley in Australia
> popularized by Douglas Biklen
> facilitator person holds wrist or arm to help point to letters of individual
	why hold arm? = poor eye/hand coordination, low muscles strength
> structured questions, fill in blank, simple matching questions used initially
> autistic - problems with generating language, difficult to put words together in meaningfully 

> Contraversy: (Australia, N.Amer & Academic Journals)
> Questions:
	1. where did the autistic clients get their new skillset?
		{learn spelling & grammar} Biklen argues these people picked up the language like kids do via exposure.
		Biklen' students reported to learn math from TV, being read to and flash cards

	2. who is the communication from?
		client or facilitator thoughts un/knowingly affect the communication?
		Theoretical: validity of procedure
		Legally: whose thoughts? ex. person & facilitator see car crash, who is giving testimony 2 people or 1?
				IF facilitator answering, the facilitator has taken self-determination away from person

		principles of facilitated comm.:
				1. clients are not to be tested, rationale- causes stress which can interfere with support

		6 arguments it's client Comm. : 1. style,speed,accuracy are constant
										2. typing errors are unique
										3. many invent spellings unique to them while same facilitator
										4. unusual phrases typed 
										5. content typed not known to facilitator
										6. individuals reveal their personalities



		Calculator & Singer tested 5 kids for 3 months, given 2 forms of Peabody Picture Vocab Test, 
			2 testing sessions separated by 2 weeks, 1 week facilitator not present. when present the
			facilitator wore earplugs with white noise. all 5 kids scored below norm when facilitator not there.

	3. what was the autistic client pre-treatment condition?
		there's no documented case of autistic person eventually typing independently 
	
	4. who is communicating?
		study in OD Heck Dev. Centre, Schenectady New York: controlled study, 
		12 participants 16-30 yrs all have been using Fac.Comm. for 5-12 months.
		T-barrier was used for 3 conditions:
				1. facilitated condition, client only was shown card & answer w/ facilitator
				2. non-facilitated condition, client shown card w/ no facilitator interaction
				3. distractor condition, both client & facilitator shown pictures, client answered w/ facilitator.
					half the time picture shown to client were same for facilitator

		total of 180 trials, clients showed zero communication
		Wheeler was trying to prove Fac.Comm. worked

		facilitators made 10 short answer questions clients could answer
		1. client answered using fac.comm. = 4/5 got perfect score
		2. questions prerecorded & asked both the client and facil. over earphones = 3/5 got perfect score
		3. client heard question over earphones and facil. heard music = 0/5 got perfect score

		Moore study
			first part facil. left room, client saw & touch object, listen to description of it.
			second part, same but client's caregiver talked to them about specific topic
			18 objects to 5 clients = zero were identified
			17 topics to 5 clients  = zero "              "

		when facil. couldn't hear questions NO client got any question correct
		Szempruch & Jacobson 127 trials, 23 clients = zero correct answers




lect 2a: Subliminal Messages p.287-303
----------------------------------------
> subliminal persuasion = use of hidden imperceptible stimuli to manipulate viewers/listeners to behave in a modified way

> many believe to be methods of advertisers and large corporations. <<<-----Prof. Wilson Bryan Key
	$50 million/yr subliminal self help tapes

> "Eat popcorn/drink coke":	James Vicary 1950s
	(41% people believed in subliminal messages >> [1980s] 80% ---NO scientific review)

	Fort Lee New Jersey Vicary study - 6 wks, flashed message 1/3 millisecond every 5 seconds. 
	Vicary claimed increase in popcorn sales 58%, 18% coke  --------- NEVER HAPPENDED

	CBC study "call now" 352 times on 'Close-Up' show, no one called or got the message, 500 ppl got hungry/thirsty

	Precon Process & Equip. = patent rights for subliminal 

	US Nat'l Assoc. Breadcasters, Britain, Australia = banned subliminal ads

> advertising, TV,radio, film used subliminal
	George Miller made Mad Max subliminal, no proof it worked

> "SUBLIMINAL"
	= 'limen of consciousness', a line separating conscious from unconscious

	Johan Friedrich Herbart - ideas differed from another in strength, competing to rise above the 
							limen of consciousness = consciously experienced
							subliminally (below the limen) can still affect what we experience consciously & behave


	trying to gain conscious control of cognitive processes == halt in process
	sensory information is a continuum of being aware and not

	2 thresholds:
		subjective threshold - stimulus individual claims 'guess/'feels' but event prescence observers do not report	

			psychologist Pierce & Jastrow = pressure on finger
			Sidis used cards
			-- adjust intensity or duration of stimulus = people no longer aware between events


		objective threshold - (lower level) stimulus observer is no longer able to descriminate between events/ can't detect
						** no evidence that events affect behaviour, if stimulus is below objective != effect


> Wilson Bryan Key & subliminals
	Key's claim ads influence buying by imbedding sex words & symbols
	
	key's 'subliminal' = selective attention
	
	claims are contradictory to science of neurophysiology = perceive+analyse+comprhend ad < 1 milisecond

	"U-buy" backwards on rum, 1 month sex subliminal in playboy, 
	pre-trial for Judas Priest Key failed to answer question so judge refused to allow him in the court

> subliminal auditory self help
	some tapes warn you about the fraudulent tapes that use subliminal techniques that dont work
	
	Merikle: subliminal tapes and did spectrographic analysis and found just music on tapes

	Hal Becker business man started subliminal audiotapes 1978-79, 
		50 department stores played "i am honest; i will not steal" with claim reduction in theft (no evidence)

	visual subliminals limit length of exposure Backward exposure
	audio subliminals stimulus is reduced by volume, basil membrane affected by physical energy 
		-- how to separate drowned out signal from masked stimulus?

	no evidence

	Greenwald study: volunteers did paperwork of self-esteem & memory, used tapes for 5 wks, half got correct instructions
		for the tapes the other half got instructions for either tape. after 5 wks, paperwork again on self esteem & memory
		results show NO effect. subjects believed the tapes worked. testimonials = worthless.

> subliminals in rock music
	1982 Gary Greenwald lectured on 'backward masking' in rock music = message by playing music backwards

	messages not apparent when music played normally but claims message unconsciously evil

	are these messages really there? ------------ music backwards sounds like Swedish chef on muppets

	backwards music has a word or phrase only if listener is told about it but otherwise is garbage

	"jesus loves you" <<< = 'we smell sausage'

	Pink Floyd "what shall we do now?" <<< ' congrats you have found a secret message, please send answer to old pink'

	NO effect of backwards messages on listeners un/consciously

	teens & Ozzy 1984 "suicide solution" forward subliminal = was ANTI suicide court case dismissed
	1985 christmas, teens & Judas Priest "beyond the realms of death" forward subliminal 'do it'


	


lect 2b: Sex and Gender Diversity p.275-285
--------------------------------------------

> sex = Indo_Euro word, dichotomous, 1 from the other
		Latin _sexus_ either of 2 divisions of organic nature --male/female

	sex refers to biology:  1. sex chromosomes
							2. sex hormones
							3. gonads
							4. internal reprod organs
							5. gametes
							6. external genitalia
							7. 2nd sex characteristics

	males = XY chromosomes, androgen,testes,vas deferens....
	females = XX chromosomes, estrogen, ovaries ....
	biological criteria for defining male/female differs culturally

> gender = Indo_Euro word systems of classification may be many categories

	culturally constructed categories for people: boys/men & girls/women based on age

	external genitals determines if male then dressed in blue/ pink if female

	gender roles differ culturally, gender role enactment conform to culture's gender 

	Canada: sex is legally defined on external genitals + 2nd sex characteristics

	transsexuals = uncomfortable with natal sex & prefer to be other sex

	sexual identity != biology of natal sex

> changing gender
	either gender role behavior can be done by either gender

	androgynous individuals = masculine+feminine, Grace Jones singer
	gender undifferentiated individuals = non-femine/masculine, "Pat" saturday night live

	transgendered != transsexuals (desire to change external genitals)

> 2 sexes enough?
	intersexed individual Chris Androgen Insensitive Syndrome(AIS) androgens receptor fail to read androgen.
	Chris has female sex genitals but is infertile & no menstruation. not male not female.

	babies with ambiguous genitals = surgery == psych + physical trauma

	Dominican Republic - 3 sexes: males/females/guevedoche 'eggs at 12'
		guevedoche = XY chromonsomes, 5-alpha reductase which converts testosterone, male genitals form at puberty
		not males/not females. raised as girls the puberty live as males. 2 genders: boy/man girl/woman

> 2 genders enough?
	gender is dichotomous

	Canada: children behave as opposite gender = diagnosed Gender Indentity Disorder, very harmful.
			Daphne Scholinski was one. NO EVIDENCE kids with GID = mental disorder

	gender parameters in other cultures:	1. type of work performed
											2. religious activities engaged in
											3. sex position used
											4. if sexually abstinent or not
											5. sexual orientation
											6. clothing worn & appearance
											7. mannerisms
	alt gender terms = { alyha, hwama,hijra,sadhin,bakla,kathoey,mahu, * fa'afafine (Samoa)}

	Oman culture: 3 genders= boy/man| girl/woman| xanith -bio males but not boys/men/girls/woman
		man = penile penetration of sex partners male or female
		xanith = NO penetration of sex partner but receive anal sex ----- sex position defines gender

		xanith masculine + feminine behavior, interact with both women/men private/public
		wear unpatterned coloured robes parting hair on the side





lect 3a:  Where does Schizoprenia come from? p.209-215
-------------------------------------------------------
> schizophrenia is adult behaviour, mental illness = wrong feelings,thoughts,behaviour
> 1 in 100 has schizo break, 600 people in Lethbridge
> Amer Psych Assoc. - Diagnostic & Stats Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV)
> 1 symptom = delusions, beliefs that aren't true, emotions not matched to situation
> US schizo people felt that the Communists were to get them
> Canada schizo felt it was RCMP out to get them
> next door neighbor in grad school felt profs were trying to fail him
> 2 years before others understand its mental illness

> what happens
	often leave school,work, get hospitalized and treated
	psychotherapy does not work its the brain not enviro being the problem

	25% = recover few - no symptoms
	30% = do okay but have problems
	30% = bad in/out of hospital/jobs, never marry
	10% = suicide

> genetics & risk
	inheritance matters: schizo parent = 10%, schizo twin= 50%
	public risk is 1%

	Scarr & McCartney - Genotype Enviro Correlation.
		adopted kids with bio parent with schizo = 10% risk
		bio parents no schizo with adopted kid with schizo = 2%

	metabolism of frontal and temporal don't work properly.
	study of eye movement because brain control it and can be studied

> childhood / stress
	trace backwards, some people with schizo were in 3rd fetal month when mother got the flu - possible damage to brain

	schizo more likely to have stressful births -ambiguous term-

	Israel study - long term repeated stress

	less women than men get schizo, woman have emphasis on friendship, support, cooperation helps lower stress


> variable people normal except for illness
